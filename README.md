# ChessLegacy

In my 3rd year of university, we had a class to learn the basics of object oriented programming in C++. I recently rediscovered my submission for the final project of this class, where I implemented a simple chess client, and decided to upload it here for posterity.

**Please note** wrote this in 2013, with only a couple of years of simple basic coding under my belt ðŸ˜‡
